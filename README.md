### 📚 Neo4j Knowledge Graph

The **Neo4j Knowledge Graph** in BirthBuddy is instrumental in curating personalized meal plans for expectant mothers. It maps popular dishes from each state or region, allowing the system to generate balanced meal plans that include local, traditional foods. This knowledge graph takes into account the mother’s medical reports, dietary needs, and preferences to create a 7-day meal plan that reflects her current or chosen location.

- **Graph Visualization**: Neo4j maps relationships between local dishes, nutrients, and medical guidelines. This allows for dynamic generation of meal plans that cater to both nutritional requirements and cultural preferences.
  
<p align="center">
  <img src="media/v2 (7).png" alt="BirthBuddy Logo" width="1000">
</p>

For example, a mother in Kerala might receive a meal plan incorporating traditional dishes such as idiyappam and avial, while ensuring it meets her pregnancy-specific nutritional needs. The knowledge graph bridges cultural diversity with personalized health advice, offering expectant mothers comfort and familiarity in their meals.
